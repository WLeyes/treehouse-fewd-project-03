- 3 errors listed, 3 error all relate to my heading which uses unsupported techniques to achieve the effect.
I have provided a suitable fallback for unsupported browsers.

The included Javascript is only in place to detect that something has been entered in to the field and changes the background green if not null onblur.<br>I am relying on HTML5 with the inclusion of patterns to handle validation where necessary.
I decided in the interest of time not to handle checking if radio buttons and checkboxes have been selected/checked.


W/ this project I don't feel that the legend tag is being used correctly as per w3. Yes it makes sense for Contact information and Newsletter because we are naming the grouping however the others are asking a question which news letters you would like to receive and in which format along with what other topics. IMO I really feel that legend is not the appropriate tag.
